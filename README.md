# DataSparks-CanadianEconomyAnalysis
BIG DATA LAB PROJECT PROPOSAL

TITLE : Pre and Post Covid-19 analysis of Canadian Economy
TEAM : Raksha Harish, Vignesh Perumal, Anjali Thomas

Description : 
In this project we aim to perform a comparative study of economic activity in Canada pre and post-covid19. We would be looking towards www150.statcan.gc.ca for our base datasets 
of 11 specific industries (and their provincial splits for those available) in Canada and studying their performance based on the historical data extending as far back as 20 years 
if required. We would also attempt to set an international context to the observations based on data taken from IMF datasets on the Canadian GDP and Global economic indicators. 
We plan to use AWS in this study for ETL and data processing. 

As a use-case from this study, we would further like to utilize the conclusions gathered to validate if the trends observed for the different industries correlate with the stock 
prices of major companies belonging to their respective industries in Canada during the time period. For this effort, we would be utilizing and integrating TSX data to our base
datasets from websites mentioned below.
