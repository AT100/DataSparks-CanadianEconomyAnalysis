BIG DATA LAB PROJECT PROPOSAL

TITLE : Pre and Post Covid-19 analysis of Canadian Economy
TEAM : Raksha Harish, Vignesh Perumal, Anjali Thomas

Description : 
In this project we aim to perform a comparative study of economic activity in Canada pre and post-covid19. We would be looking towards www150.statcan.gc.ca for our base datasets 
of 11 specific industries (and their provincial splits for those available) in Canada and studying their performance based on the historical data extending as far back as 20 years 
if required. We would also attempt to set an international context to the observations based on data taken from IMF datasets on the Canadian GDP and Global economic indicators. 
We plan to use AWS in this study for ETL and data processing. 

As a use-case from this study, we would further like to utilize the conclusions gathered to validate if the trends observed for the different industries correlate with the stock 
prices of major companies belonging to their respective industries in Canada during the time period. For this effort, we would be utilizing and integrating TSX data to our base
datasets from websites mentioned below.

Use case 1:

Pre and Post Covid Economic Analysis
<need to specify how long is pre covid we are considering? 1 year? 5 years?>
Are we doing this table wise, if not what all tables need to be merged??
International Trade Merchandise- Import/export
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1210012101

GDP - all industries 
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610043401

CPI Index - Unemployment rate
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000401

Domestic and international Itinerant movements

Monthly survey of food services and drinking places

# consumer price index CPI -> 13  tables available for 13 provinces/territories. 
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000401

Each table has a row  ‘All-items’ CPI for all rows.
Can create a new DF for all the provinces with the CPI for  ‘All-items’.
#Labour force characteristics
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028703

Visualizations for unemployment rate, participation rate, employment rate for all provinces/territories comparison values. ---> <<what time period>>

# we have Retails trade sales in Canada - https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2010000801

The GDP table gives gdp of Retail Trades
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610043401

These two(sales vs gdp) can be combined/compared

# We have ‘Actual Hours Worked Table’
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028901

And the GDP table, which also categorizes by industry.

These two tables can be merged based on industry, give insight on hours worked vs gdp <<<over period x>>>

# International merchandise trade vs GDP
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1210012101

Has several tables for different industries. This can be combined/transformed accordingly.

We can analyze/transform GDP table industries to combine both these and get the ratio of merchandise trade/gdp for various industries
